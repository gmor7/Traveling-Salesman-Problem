This considers a simplified version of the travelling salesman problem:

"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?"

We are providing a file, city-data.txt, containing the latitudes and longitudes of the fifty state capitals of the U.S.A.

The end output is a visualisation of the map and routes, created using Matplotlib:
